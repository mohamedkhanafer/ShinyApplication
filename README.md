# ShinyApplication and Leaflet for Housing Data 

My initial idea for this project came from *Spot a Home*, a Housing platform I used to choose my appartment. And the main tool  used for my decision was actually their interactive map. What made it very handy was this ability to be able to filter some of the apartmentsâ€™ attributes for my preferences and easily interact with various dimensions of the data.

I thus developped a Shiny Application that integrates an advanced and interactive Leaflet map that would help easily navigate through the available properties and allow investing into the best houses. 

I developped this application using the Lucas County OH Housing dataset from the spData library, and then did a second application on real data for properties around Madrid.

The result of the Shiny application is the following:
